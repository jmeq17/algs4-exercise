/*
Index priority-queue implementation. Implement the basic operations in the
index priority-queue API on page 320 by modifying Algorithm 2.6 as follows: Change
pq[] to hold indices, add an array keys[] to hold the key values, and add an array qp[]
that is the inverse of pq[] â€” qp[i] gives the position of i in pq[] (the index j such that
pq[j] is i). Then modify the code in Algorithm 2.6 to maintain these data structures.
Use the convention that qp[i] = -1 if i is not on the queue, and include homework.a method
contains() that tests this condition. You need to modify the helper methods exch()
and less() but not sink() or swim().
