/*
Dice simulation. The following code computes the exact probability distribution for the sum of two dice:

    int SIDES = 6;
    double[] dist = new double[2*SIDES+1];
    for (int i = 1; i <= SIDES; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j <= SIDES; j++)
            dist[i+j] += 1.0;

    for (int k = 2; k <= 2*SIDES; k++)
        dist[k] /= 36.0;

The value dist[i] is the probability that the dice sum to k. Run experiments to validate
this calculation simulating N dice throws, keeping track of the frequencies of occurrence
of each value when you compute the sum of two random integers between 1
and 6. How large does N have to be before your empirical results match the exact results
to three decimal places?
